## Introduction

Detecting and preventing absconding events in beehives is a critical challenge for beekeepers. Our Smart Beehive Monitoring System aims to address this issue by leveraging advanced technologies to provide early and reliable detection of abscondment.

Manually detecting when bees abandon a beehive is challenging and often leads to delayed responses. Understanding the factors contributing to their departure is crucial for effective beekeeping practices.

### Solution

Our solution involves the deployment of camera sensors at the beehive entrance. These sensors capture data that is processed by an artificial intelligence (AI) model. The AI model distinguishes between bees carrying pollen and those that do not, offering a more accurate and timely indication of potential absconding events.
